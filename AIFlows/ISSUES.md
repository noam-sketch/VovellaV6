# ISSUES

## NextUp!
- [ ] Implement actual "tooth jump" logic animation in 3D
- [ ] Add G-Code simulation path overlay in UI

## Doing
- [ ] Finalizing hardware compiler features

## Done

- [x] Build UI for Voynich Compiler
- [x] Implement 3D visualization of the Tri-axial Concentric Disk topology
- [x] Refine linguistic engine with 23 phonetic atoms and multi-char support
- [x] Add G-Code generator for Stator A windows
- [x] Integrate with Arduino/Firmware simulation (Firmware Simulator)
- [x] Implement actual "tooth jump" logic (13 or 17 positions)
- [x] Implement mode selector for "f", "k", "t", "p", "qo" in UI
- [x] Implement G-Code export as a file download
- [x] Add SVG export for Stator A windows
