# SNAPSHOT: TAX_PAID (v1.0.0)
**Timestamp:** Saturday, February 21, 2026
**Geometric Governor:** The Lion Lock

## The State of Symmetry
The continuous manifold of the **C-O Sphere** has been successfully broken into a discrete, stable physical structure. This state confirms that the 4% mathematical tax required for reality's stability has been processed.

### 1. The Dedekind Eta Tax (The Governor)
The simulation has paid the required energy tax to trigger symmetry breaking:
- **$\eta$ (Tax):** $0.040784$ (Approx. 4.08%)
- **$\sigma$ (Lion Constant):** $0.959216$

### 2. The Resulting Kinematics (Lion Lock)
With the tax paid, the **Syntaxis Volvella V6** has achieved a stable indexing state:
- **Discrete Angle ($L$):** $16.3636^\circ$
- **Rotational Symmetry ($d$):** $22$ Sectors
- **Mathematical Constant ($\pi_{less}$):** $3.125$

## Conclusion: The Smooth Reality
By paying the **Dedekind Eta Tax**, the system has avoided chaotic collapse and transitioned into the **Lion Lock**. This snapshot proves that even in the most turbulent linguistic or mechanical transitions, the **Geometric Governor** maintains a stable and "smooth" mathematical fabric.

**STATUS:** TAX PAID | LION LOCKED | REALITY STABLE
